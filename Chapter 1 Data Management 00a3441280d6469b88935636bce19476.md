# Chapter 1: Data Management

# 1. Introduction

**Core Concepts**

- *data* describe and represent facts about the world
- *data* needs *context* to be meaningful
- *data* has to be *created*
- *data* is rarely static (data is cleansed, transformed, merged, enhanced, aggregated, and new data is created as data is used)

**Data management principles**

- Data is an asset with unique properties
- The value of data can and should be expressed in economic terms
    - An “asset” is an economic resource and, as such, it can be converted into money
    - Data also supports decision-making in the economic system
    - Data may have costs:
        - Obtaining, storing, refining data
        - Opportunity costs of missing data
        - Risk mitigation and potential cost of risks
- Managing data means managing the quality of data
- It takes metadata to manage data (they provide context).
    - Not only the business,  technical, and operational metadata, but also metadata embedded in data architecture, data models, data security requirements, data integration standards, and data operational processes.
- It takes planning to manage data
- Data management is cross-functional; it requires a range of skills and expertise
- Data management requires an enterprise perspective
    - Data originates in multiple places within an organization (different standards, procedures, goals, etc.).
- Data management must account for a range of perspective (and adaptation)
- Data management is **life cycle** management and different types of data have different life cycle characteristics.
    - *data lineage*
- Managing data includes managing the risks associated with data (they can be lost, stolen, or misused).
- Data management requirements must drive IT decisions.
- Effective data management requires leadership commitment.

Data management strategy

- A strategic plan is a high-level course of action (choices, decisions) to achieve high-level goals.
- The components of a data management strategy should include:
    - Compelling vision for data management
    - Guiding principles, values, and management perspectives
    - The mission and long-term directional goals of data management
    - Short-term program objectives SMART (specific, measurable, actionable, realistic, time-bound)
    - Proposed measures of data management success
    - Descriptions of data management roles, organizations and responsibilities.
    - A draft implementation road-map with projects and action items.

Knowledge Area Context Diagrams:

- Definition & Goals
- Four phases: Plan > Control > Develop > Operate
    - These are used to classify activities
    - Planning activities set the strategic and tactical course for meeting data management goals
    - Control activities ensure the ongoing quality of data and systems
    - Development activities are organized around the system development life cycle
    - Operational activities support the use, maintenance, and enhancement of systems and processes
- Inputs & Suppliers > Activities & Participants > Deliverables & Consumers
- Tools, Techniques and Metrics
    - Tools are applications and other technologies that enable the goals of the Knowledge Area
    - Techniques are the methods and procedures to perform activities and produce deliverables (e.g., conventions, best practices, standards, etc.)
    - Metrics are standards for measurements or evaluations of performance, progress, quality, etc.
- Business & Technical drivers
- Organization and Culture
