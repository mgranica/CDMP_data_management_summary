# 3. Essential Concepts

## 3.1 Ethical Principles for Data

- **Respect for persons**
    - Treat people in a way that respect their dignity and autonomy as human individuals. Protect the dignity of those with ‚Äúdiminish autonomy‚Äù
- **Beneficence**

    - Minimise harm
- **Justice**
    - The fair and equitable treatment of people

European Data Protection Supervisor EDPS, 2015: ‚ÄúThe engineering, philosophical, legal and moral implications of developments in **Data processing and Big Data:**

- Future-oriented regulation of data processing and respect for the rights to privacy and data protection
- Accountable controllers who determine personal information processing
- Privacy-conscious engineering and design of data processing products and devices
- empowered individuals
- **NO ‚Üí Right to request removal of personal data**

## 3.2 Principles behind Data Privacy Law

<aside>
üí° Privacy regulations have been driven by human rights violations experienced during WW2 in Europe. The European Union‚Äôs Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) established 8 guidelines and principles for Fair Information Processing Standards.

</aside>

- Limitations on data collection
- An expectation that data will be of a high quality
- The requirement that when data is collected. it will be for a specific purpose
- Limitations on data usage
- Security safeguards
- An expectation of openness and transparency
- The right of an individual to challenge the accuracy data related to himself or herself
- Accountability of organisations to follow the guidelines

### 3.2.1 General Data Protection Regulation of the EU

| GDPR | description of the principle |

- Privacy by design

## 3.3 Online data in an ethical Context

- **Ownership of data:** right to control own personal data

- **identity:** identity must be correct, or one can opt for a private identity
- **freedom of speech online:** expression rather than online bullying insulting

## 3.4 Risks of unethical Data Handling Practices

<aside>
üí° Data should be measured against Data Quality dimensions such as accuracy and timeliness to ensure it is trustworthy.

</aside>

**Unethical data practices include**

- **Timing**: Omission or inclusion of data points based on timing, e.g., market manipulation of end-of-day stock price.
- **Misleading Visualisations:**
    - e.g., Changing scale, comparing facts without clarifying their relationship
    - Unclear definitions or Invalid Comparison
    - Provide context which informs meaning.
    - Statistical ‚Äúsmoothing‚Äù or over-training of a statistical model.
- **Bias**

    - Biased use of collected data
    - Hunch and search
    - Biased sampling methodology
    - Context and Culture
- **Unclear Definition or invalid Comparisons**
    - Business definitions and context of comparisons is necessary
- **Transforming and Integrating Data**
    - Limited knowledge of data‚Äôs origin and lineage
    - Data of poor quality
    - Unreliable metadata
    - No documentation of data remediation history
- **Obfuscation / Redaction of Data:**¬†Risk of exposure is common in the following:
    - Data aggregation
    - Data marking
    - Data masking

## 3.5 Establish an ethical Data culture

- **Review current state data handling practices:**
    - Understand degree of current practices to ethical and compliance drivers
    - Employees understanding of ethical implications of existing practices

        - Timeline of activities that can be approved by management
