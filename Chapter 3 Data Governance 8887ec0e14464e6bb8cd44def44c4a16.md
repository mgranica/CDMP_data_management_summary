# Chapter 3: Data Governance

# 1. Introduction

<aside>
üí° Data Governance is the exercise of authority and control (planning, implementation, monitoring, and enforcement) over the management of data assets. Its purpose is to ensure that data is managed properly, according to the policies and best practices, and guides all other data management functions.

</aside>

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è

All organisations make decisions about data, regardless of whether they have a formal Data Governance function.

Data governance is an ongoing program focused on ensuring that the organisation gets value from its data and reduces risks related to data.

The Data governance function is separate from the IT governance function (decisions on hardware, software, and overall technical architecture)

</aside>

- **Strategy**: Defining, communicating and driving execution of Data Strategy and Data Governance.
- **Policy**: Setting and enforcing policies relating to data and Metadata life cycle management (access, usage, security and quality, documentation, and purging)
- **Standards**: Setting and enforcing Data Management standards
- **Oversight**: Providing hands-on observation, audit and correction in key areas of quality, privacy, security, and data management policies and procedures
- **Compliance**: Ensuring the organisation can meet data-related regulatory compliance requirements
- **Issue management:** Identifying, defining, escalating and resolving issues related to data security, data access, data quality, regulatory compliance, data ownership, policy, standards, terminology or data governance procedures
- **Data Management projects**: Sponsoring efforts to improve data management practices
- **Data asset valuation**: Setting standards and processes to define business value of assets

## 1.1 Business drivers

**Reducing risk**

- **General risk management**: oversight of the risks data poses on finances, reputation, legal e-discovery, regulatory issues
- **Data security**: Protection of data assets through controls for the availability, usability, integrity, consistency, auditability, and security of data
- **Privacy:** Control of private, confidential and Personal Identifying information (PII) through policy and compliance monitoring

**Improving processes**

- **Regulatory Compliance**
- **Data Quality improvement**
- **Metadata Management**
    - Business glossary and other Metadata
- **Efficiency en development projects**:
    - SDLC improvements
- **Vendor Management**
    - Contracts dealing with Data Governance is separate from IT governance and is ongoing

## 1.2 Goals And Principles

1. Enable an organization to manage its data as an asset
2. Define, approve, communicate and implement principles, policies, procedures, metrics, tools and responsibilities for data management
3. Monitor and guide policy compliance, data usage and management activities

**Program to achieve these GOALS**

- **Sustainable:** Ongoing and depends on business leadership, sponsorship and ownership
- **Embedded** DG Activities incorporated into development methods, use of analytics, management of Master Data and Risk Management
- **Measured:** to show positive financial impact
- **Foundational Principles**:
    - **Leadership and Strategy** committed leadership, driven by enterprise business strategy
    - **Business-driven** DG is a **business program** and must govern IT decisions relating to data
    - **Shared responsibility** Across all Data Management knowledge areas
    - **Multi-layered** All levels from local to enterprise
    - **Framework-based** Establish an operating framework
    - **Principle-based** Principles are the basis of policies

## 1.3 Essential Concepts

<aside>
üí° Ensuring data is managed without directly executing data management. **Separation of duties between oversight and execution - RACI model**

</aside>

### 1.3.7 Data Asset Valuation

<aside>
üí° Process of understanding and calculating the economic value of data to the organisation

</aside>

Data sets are font interchangeable (fingible) between organisations. How an organisation gets value from customers data can be a competitive differentiator

**Ways of measuring value**

- **Replacement Cost** of data lost in a breach or disaster
- **Market Value**. As a business asset at the time of a merge or acquisition
- **Identified opportunities** The income to be gained
- **Selling data** as a package, or the insights to be gained
- **Risk cost** Potential penalties, remediation costs and litigation expenses

**Principles for data Asset Accounting** ‚Üí Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

| Principle | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Accountability principle | An organisation must identify individuals who are ultimately accountable for data and content of all types |
| Asset principle | Data and content of all types are assets and have characteristics of other assets. they should be managed, secured and accounted for as other material or financial assets |
| Audit Principle | The accuracy of data and content is subject to periodic audit by an independent body. |
| Due diligence principle | If a risk is known. It must be reported.
If a risk is possible, it must be confirmed
Data risks include risks related to poor data management practices |
| Going Concern principle | Data and content are critical to successful, ongoing business operations and management
(i.e., they are not viewed as temporary means to achieve results or merely as a business by-
product). |
| level of valuation | Value the data as an asset at a level that makes more sense, or it is easier to measure |
| liability principle | Financial liability connected to data or content based on regulatory and ethical misuse or missmanagement |
| quality principle | The meaning, accuracy and lifecycle of data and content can affect the financial status of theorganisation |
| risk principle | There is a risk associated with data and content  |
| value principle | There is value in data and content, based on the ways these are used to meet an organization‚Äôs objectives, their intrinsic marketability, and/or their contribution to the organization‚Äôs goodwill valuation.
The value if information reflects its contribution to the organization offset by the cost of maintenance and movement |
